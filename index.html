      Origin and history The kipferl, an Austrian crescent-shaped pastry, can be
      dated back to at least the 13th century in Austria, and came in various
      shapes.[8][9] The kipferl can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings
      (some consider the rugelach a form of kipferl).[10] The original
      Boulangerie Viennoise in 1909 (when it was owned by Philibert Jacquet).
      The bakery proper is at left and its tea salon at right. In either 1838 or
      1839, an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese
      bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris.[9][11]
      This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the kipferl and
      the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and
      the concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for
      supposedly Vienna-style pastries).

      The French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant)
      shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across the
      world.[citation needed] The earliest known recipe for the present-day
      croissant appears in 1905, although the name croissant appears among the
      "fantasy or luxury breads" in 1853.[12] Earlier recipes for non-laminated
      croissants can be found in the 19th century and at least one reference to
      croissants as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850.[13]
      Zang himself returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press magnate, but
      the bakery remained popular for some time afterwards, and was mentioned in
      several works of the time: "This same M. Zank [sic]...founded around 1830
      [sic], in Paris, the famous Boulangerie viennoise".[14]

      Several sources praise this bakery's products: "Paris is of exquisite
      delicacy; and, in particular, the succulent products of the Boulangerie
      Viennoise";[15] "which seemed to us as fine as if it came from the
      Viennese bakery on the rue de Richelieu".[16] By 1869, the croissant was
      well established enough to be mentioned as a breakfast staple,[17] and in
      1872, Charles Dickens wrote (in his periodical All the Year Round) of "the
      workman's pain de m√©nage and the soldier's pain de munition, to the dainty
      croissant on the boudoir table"[18] The puff pastry technique that now
      characterizes the croissant was already mentioned in the late 17th
      century, when La Varenne's Le Cuisinier fran√ßois gave a recipe for it in
      the 1680 ‚Äì and possibly earlier ‚Äì edition. It was typically used not on
      its own but for shells holding other ingredients (as in a vol-au-vent). It
      does not appear to be mentioned in relation to the croissant until the
      20th century.

      The first recipe corresponding to the modern croissant, not only for the
      shape but also the texture of the dough and the taste, was published in
      1906, in Paris, in Colombi√©'s Nouvelle Encyclop√©die culinaire.[19] Sylvain
      Claudius Goy was a French chef who is sometimes said to have recorded the
      earliest recipe of the modern croissant.[20] His 1915 book La Cuisine
      Anglo-Americaine contains a croissant recipe which Frey Fine Books
      consider to be the first such recipe published, and they describe the
      recipe as having "[given] birth to the croissant of present day".[21]
      Goy's recipe uses a laminated yeast dough known in French as p√¢te
      feuillet√©e lev√©e.[citation needed]
